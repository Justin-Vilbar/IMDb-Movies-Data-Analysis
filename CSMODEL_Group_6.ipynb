Both correlations are statistically significant with p-values of 0.0000, indicating that the relationships are not due to random chance. However, the correlation between IMDb rating and vote count is notably stronger than that of Metascore, suggesting that IMDb ratings are a better predictor of audience engagement, as reflected by the number of votes a movie receives. While neither correlation is strong, the data shows that movies with higher IMDb ratings tend to attract more votes than those with high Metascores."

        "**1. Genre Significantly Impacts Both IMDb Ratings and Vote Counts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The box plot of ratings by genre revealed noticeable differences in the distribution of IMDb ratings across various genres. Genres like Film-Noir, War, Western, History, and Biography generally exhibited higher median and mean ratings, with less spread and fewer outliers, suggesting consistent positive reception. Conversely, genres like Horror, Fantasy, Family, and Action had lower average ratings and medians, along with wider spreads and more outliers, indicating more varied audience responses. The bar graph of total votes per genre showed that Drama, Comedy, Action, and Adventure genres received the highest total vote counts, suggesting a larger audience base and higher engagement for these genres.\n",
        "\n",
        "The statistical inference using ANOVA confirmed that these observed differences in both IMDb ratings (F-statistic: 33.7921, P-value: 0.0000) and vote counts (F-statistic: 13.5042, P-value: 0.0000) across genres are statistically significant. This strongly supports the conclusion that **genre is a significant factor influencing both a movie's rating and its popularity on IMDb.** The variation in ratings and votes across genres suggests that audience preferences and critical reception are not uniform and are heavily influenced by the film's genre classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Runtime Has a Weak Positive Correlation with IMDb Rating, with Variation Across Genres:**\n",
        "\n",
        "We investigated the relationship between a movie's runtime and its IMDb rating. The scatter plot showed a slight upward trend, suggesting longer movies might have higher ratings, but the relationship appeared weak. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the overall dataset is 0.3702 with a p-value of 0.0000, indicating a weak but statistically significant positive correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further analysis at the genre level revealed varying degrees of correlation. While most genres showed a weak positive correlation, some, like Thriller (r = 0.444), Sport (r = 0.496), and Mystery (r = 0.458), exhibited slightly stronger positive relationships. Film-Noir, however, showed no significant correlation (r = 0.0396, p = 0.8978).\n",
        "\n",
        "The statistical inference confirmed a weak positive correlation overall (Pearson Correlation: 0.370, P-value: 0.000). This leads to the conclusion that **while there is a statistically significant tendency for longer movies to receive slightly higher ratings, runtime is not a major determinant of a movie's IMDb rating across all genres.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. IMDb Rating Correlates More Strongly with Audience Engagement (Votes) Than Metascore:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparing the influence of user-generated IMDb ratings and critic-based Metascores on audience engagement (vote count), the scatter plots suggested that IMDb ratings might have a stronger relationship with votes. The Pearson correlation between IMDb rating and votes is 0.3978 (p=0.0000), while for Metascore and votes it is 0.2418 (p=0.0000). Both are statistically significant, but IMDb rating shows a stronger correlation.\n",

        "Analyzing these correlations across different time periods revealed that IMDb rating consistently had a stronger correlation with vote count than Metascore, although both correlations have generally declined over time. A one-way ANOVA comparing the strength of correlation between IMDb rating and votes vs. Metascore and votes across periods yielded an F-statistic of 8.1399 and a p-value of 0.0098. This statistically significant result confirms that there is a difference in the strength of these correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, we conclude that **IMDb rating shows a stronger and more consistent positive correlation with audience engagement (vote count) than Metascore.** This highlights the importance of user opinion in driving popularity on the IMDb platform, more so than professional critic reviews, although both are statistically linked to voting behavior.\n",

        "**4. Gross Earnings Have a Moderate to Strong Positive Correlation with Vote Count, but a Very Weak Correlation with IMDb Rating:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We explored whether higher gross earnings in the US and Canada correlate with higher IMDb ratings and vote counts. The scatter plot of gross earnings vs. IMDb rating showed a highly scattered distribution with only a very subtle upward trend. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.122 with a p-value of 0.000, indicating a very weak but statistically significant positive correlation. This suggests that **while there's a statistically verifiable link, US and Canadian box office success has a minimal impact on a movie's average IMDb rating.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, the scatter plot of gross earnings vs. votes showed a more apparent positive trend. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.612 with a p-value of 0.000, indicating a moderate to strong positive correlation. This suggests that **movies with higher gross earnings in the US and Canada tend to receive significantly more votes on IMDb.** This indicates that financial success in this region is a stronger indicator of a movie's reach and audience engagement on the platform than it is of its average rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Association rule mining further explored the relationship between gross earnings and ratings. The rule `{gross_bin_Gross=High} → {rating_bin_Rating=Medium}` had the highest confidence (0.614), indicating that high-grossing movies are more likely to have medium IMDb ratings than high ones. The rule `{rating_bin_Rating=High} → {gross_bin_Gross=Low}` (confidence = 0.544) suggests that highly-rated movies are more likely to have low gross earnings. The absence of a strong rule like `{gross_bin_Gross=High} → {rating_bin_Rating=High}` reinforces that high gross earnings do not strongly imply a high IMDb rating. This supports the statistical inference findings that **high gross earnings are more strongly associated with a higher number of votes (popularity/reach) than with a higher average rating (critical/user reception).**\n",

        "**5. The Prolificacy of Top-Billed Actors Shows a Weak or Borderline Significant Relationship with Votes, and No Significant Relationship with Average Rating:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we examined the influence of frequently appearing, top-billed actors on movie ratings and votes. Analyzing the top 20 most frequent actors, we found that movies featuring these actors had a slightly higher average IMDb rating (6.674) compared to the overall average (6.592) and a substantial portion of the total votes (159,459,989 out of 788,612,085).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, when looking at the relationship between the number of movies an actor has been in (among this top group) and the average rating of those movies, the scatter plot showed no clear trend. The Pearson correlation coefficient was -0.086 with a high p-value of 0.719, indicating **no statistically significant linear relationship between an actor's prolificacy (within the top 20) and the average rating of their films.**\n",
        "\n",
        "For total votes, the scatter plot showed a slight upward trend. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.379 with a p-value of 0.099, indicating a weak to moderate positive correlation that is borderline statistically significant. This suggests a plausible, but not definitive, tendency for actors who appear more frequently in top roles (among this group) to be associated with movies that accumulate more votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these findings, we conclude that **while movies featuring top-billed actors generally tend to receive more votes, the sheer number of movies an actor appears in does not have a statistically significant impact on the average IMDb rating of their films.** The presence of these actors may contribute more to a movie's reach and awareness (leading to more votes) than to its average critical reception (rating).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Narrative and Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, our analysis reveals a nuanced picture of what drives movie popularity and success on IMDb. **Genre is a fundamental determinant**, significantly influencing both ratings and vote counts. While **runtime has a statistically significant but weak positive correlation with ratings**, it is not a primary driver. **Audience engagement, as measured by vote count, is more strongly correlated with IMDb user ratings than with critic Metascores**, highlighting the platform's nature as a reflection of user opinion. Furthermore, **financial success in the US and Canada (gross earnings) is a stronger predictor of a movie's reach and popularity (votes) than it is of its average rating.** Finally, while **the presence of top-billed actors is associated with higher overall vote counts**, their individual prolificacy does not significantly impact the average rating of their movies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, a movie's success on IMDb appears to be a complex interplay of its inherent attributes (genre), audience reception (IMDb rating and votes), and market performance (gross earnings). While no single factor guarantees success, understanding these relationships provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the film industry and audience behavior on this popular platform. Genre and audience engagement (votes) appear to be the most prominent factors linked to popularity and reception in this dataset, with financial success also playing a significant role in driving votes."
